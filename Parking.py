# ULTRASONIC REVERSE CAR PARKING AID
# ==================================
#
# In this project a HC-SR04 type ultrasonic sensor module is
# connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Additionally, a buzzer
# is connected. The project sounds the buzzer as the car gets
# near an obstacle.The buzzer sounds faster as the car gets
# nearer an object
